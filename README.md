## Toronto Restaurant Traffic During the Covid-19 Pandemic
After coming across this OpenTable Dataset of year-over-year comparisons of restaurant reservations over the last couple of months, as well as Google's Community Mobility Reports I wanted to see how Toronto is fairing during this pandemic and compare it to other Canadian cities.
### Summary of Insights
* The Data for Toronto is correlated with other Canadian cities, but most closely correlated to Montreal.
* Toronto's Mobility Report Data for the Retail and Recreation category is correlated Restaurant reservations, as expected.
* Proximity data for the Retail and Recreation category is most closely correlated with proximity to transit stations in Toronto.
* Forecast from Google Community Mobility Reports shows a return to normal levels by around November of this year.
* Forecast from Toronto's OpenTable data shows a return to normal levels by December.
* The slope of the recovery trendlines for cities in the OpenTable data shows clear differences in the "eagerness to return" of different cities, perhaps dictated by economic reactivation policies.
